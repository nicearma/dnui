Delete and update not used image and database
 
== Description ==

The plugin is back!!
If you have some problem after the update, please deactivate and active the plugin again!

This plugin will help you to find all in the database and all the images that are not being used/unused and give you the oportunity to clean up the database and space.

You will only delete not used/unused image, so dont worry about delete image used.

**Be careful because some plugin and theme can use images that this plugin will thing is not used** (so do test first and backup)

If you have any feedback, recommendation, comments leave me a comment in the blog!

The search code work this way, we have the rule that, one image have to be referred in minimun one post, so if the image is not referred you will see not used.

If you have problem with other plugin, you can ask me to adapt the code for work with the plugin.

The plugin will grow in the next week, with alots of options!

** Recommendations **

* Make some BACKUP of your database and the  uploads folder, because for the moment the plugin will delete the information in the datbase and your server,they are irreversible, so if something goes wrong is better have a backup.
* Performs alots of tests before use in post in production, try to use blogs with the same characteristics, since I have not tested for compatibility with other plugin, so you can see if will work fine.
* Download this plugin only from wordpress.org.
